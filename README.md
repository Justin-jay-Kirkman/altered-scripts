## Files

- `README.md`: This file
- `get_cards_data.py`: Script to download the cards data using the official
Altered API
- `get_card_images.py`: Script to download the card images from the official
Altered wbesite using the results from `get_cards_data.py`
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used by the other scripts

## Getting card data

To get the card data, run the following command:

```bash
python get_cards_data.py
```

By default, the script will download the data to the `results` directory. The
data for all languages is aggregated in a single file.

### Parameters

It is possible to change some parameters at the beginning of the script. In
particular, you can list only the languages you are interested in by changing
the `LANGUAGES` variable.

## Getting card images

**Note:** This script requires the results from `get_cards_data.py`. Make sure
to run `get_cards_data.py` first.

To get the card images, run the following command:

```bash
python get_card_images.py
```

By default, the script will download the card images to the `card_images`
directory, in one subfolder for each language. By default, the name of the
files will be the card collector number (e.g. `BTG-036-C.jpg`). Additionally,
the script will download image assets related to the card to the `card_assets`
directory. By default, the images will not be redownloaded if they already
exist.

### Parameters

It is possible to change some parameters at the beginning of the script. In
particular, you can list only the languages you are interested in by changing
the `LANGUAGES` variable. You may also choose which format to use for the
card image names by changing the `USE_COLLECTOR_NUMBERS` variable. You may also
choose whether to download the card images and/or the card assets by changing
the `DOWNLOAD_CARD_IMAGES` and `DOWNLOAD_ASSETS` variables. You may also force
redownloading the images by changing the `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` variable.
